## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

I tried a better folder structure for the Sass styling (the 7-1 pattern) and also a more sophisticated build toolchain (browsersync and other).

### Useful resources

- [Minimum Static Site Setup with Sass](https://thinkdobecreate.com/articles/minimum-static-site-sass-setup/) - This helped me setup a better build toolchain.
- [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) - Helped me with folder structure (the 7-1 pattern).
- [Get your stylesheets more organized with Sass partials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ld-aOKsEDk) - Youtube video by Kevin Powell, helped me with folder structure organization as well as some useful Sass mixins (colors map).
- [Stop using @import with Sass | @use and @forward explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0) - Another Youtube video by Kevin Powell, helped me understand `@use` and `@forward`.
